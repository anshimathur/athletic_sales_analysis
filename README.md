# Homework Assignment: Athletic Sales Analysis

## Goal/Summary
The objective of this assignment is to analyze sales data and derive insights regarding product sales, retailer performance, and temporal trends. The aim is to clean and combine datasets, answer specific questions using Python, and present the results in a meaningful way. The ultimate goal is to derive meaningful insights that can inform business decisions.

## Problem/Questions
1. **Data Cleaning and Combining**: How can we effectively clean and combine sales datasets to ensure accurate analysis?
2. **Top-Selling Regions**: Which regions, states, and cities sold the most products?
3. **Retailer Performance**: Which retailers performed best in terms of product sales?
4. **Women's Athletic Footwear Trends**: 
   - Which retailer sold the most women's athletic footwear?
   - What was the day with the highest sales of women's athletic footwear?
   - What was the week with the highest sales of women's athletic footwear?

## Observations
- While working on the analysis, we noticed that:
  - Certain regions consistently ranked high for total products sold, suggesting strong market demand in those areas (e.g., New York and California).
  - The top-performing regions and retailers often differed depending on whether the metric was total sales or the number of products sold, highlighting the importance of analyzing both perspectives.
  - Women's athletic footwear showed distinct sales peaks on certain days and weeks, which could indicate promotional periods or seasonal trends.

## Conclusion
Key Findings:
- The top-performing regions and retailers were identified based on product sales.
- Womenâ€™s athletic footwear sales exhibited clear temporal trends, with specific days and weeks showing peak sales activity.
- The use of groupby and pivot_table demonstrated similar capabilities. These functions along with others such as resampling facilitated efficient data analysis and visualization.
- These findings provide actionable insights for targeting high-performing retailers in regions with high products sales, optimizing inventory, and planning sales strategies.

## Thoughts 
- Should we expand the analysis to include additional product categories?
- Should we pull _total products sold_ for retailers to compare _total sales_?
